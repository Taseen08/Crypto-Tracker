This is a web app built using React where people can find a list of all the cryptocurrencies and their individual relevant statistics. I have utilized the Axios library to get data on cryptocurrencies from a REST API and update the content on each render, and have created and integrated a search functionality to ease the process for users to filter through the list of cryptocurrencies.
